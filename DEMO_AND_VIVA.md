# Demo script and viva guide

## Before the demo (2 minutes)
Open two terminals in `~/file-sharing-sdn`.

Terminal A:
```
sudo service openvswitch-switch start
HOG_LIMIT=1 osken-manager controller.py
```
Terminal B:
```
sudo mn -c
sudo python3 topology.py
```
At `mininet>`:
```
pingall
server python3 server.py > server.log 2>&1 &
```
Fallbacks: `sudo mn -c` if Mininet complains about leftovers; restart the controller if `pingall` loses packets.

## Demo flow (about 5 minutes)

1. **Architecture (30 s)** – show the diagram in README: h1-h3, s1, server, controller, events.jsonl link.
2. **Connectivity** – `pingall` shows 0% loss through the OS-Ken learning switch.
3. **Authentication + upload/download**
   ```
   h2 sh -c 'printf "LIST\nQUIT\n" | python3 client.py --host 10.0.0.4 --user alice --password alice123'
   h2 sh -c 'printf "UPLOAD demo.bin\nQUIT\n" | python3 client.py --host 10.0.0.4 --user alice --password alice123'
   h1 sh -c 'printf "DOWNLOAD demo.bin\nQUIT\n" | python3 client.py --host 10.0.0.4 --user bob --password bob123'
   ```
   (create `demo.bin` first with `sh head -c 5000000 /dev/urandom > demo.bin`; compare `sha256sum` of both files.)
4. **Safety** – `h2 sh -c 'printf "DOWNLOAD ../server.py\nQUIT\n" | python3 client.py --host 10.0.0.4 --user admin --password 1234'` → rejected.
5. **Dynamic SDN policy**
   ```
   h3 sh -c 'for i in 1 2 3; do python3 client.py --host 10.0.0.4 --user admin --password wrong; done'
   h3 sh -c 'printf "LIST\nQUIT\n" | timeout 5 python3 client.py --host 10.0.0.4 --user admin --password 1234'
   h2 sh -c 'printf "LIST\nQUIT\n" | python3 client.py --host 10.0.0.4 --user admin --password 1234'
   sh ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s1
   sh cat controller_events.log
   ```
   Point out: priority-200 drop flow, BLOCK response ~89 ms, h2 unaffected, UNBLOCK after ~30 s.
6. **Monitoring** – `sh tail -5 stats.csv`.
7. **Results** – `sh cat results_summary.md`; explain baseline vs SDN and the hog limiter table.

## Viva questions and short answers

- **Why TCP?** Files need reliable, ordered delivery; TCP gives that, we only add message framing.
- **How do you handle TCP being a byte stream?** Line-based commands plus exact byte counts (`UPLOAD name size`, `OK size`), so no end markers that file data could contain.
- **Why threads?** One daemon thread per client keeps the code simple; blocking I/O releases the GIL, and transfers are I/O-bound. Async would scale further; threads suffice for the demo load.
- **How do you avoid races?** Metadata writes are under a lock and atomic (temp file + rename); uploads go to `.part` and are renamed on success.
- **Path traversal?** Names must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,99}$`; tested in selftest.
- **Passwords?** Salted PBKDF2 hashes in memory; no TLS (limitation).
- **How does the socket app talk to the SDN?** Server appends JSON events to `events.jsonl`; the controller tails it. Works because Mininet hosts share the filesystem; a real system would use a network channel (REST/message queue).
- **What exactly does the controller do?** After 3 AUTH_FAIL from one IP in 60 s it installs a priority-200 drop flow IP→server:5000 with a 30 s hard timeout; flow-removed message logs UNBLOCK.
- **Why those priorities?** Learned forwarding 1, table-miss 0, static ACL 150, hog limiter 160, block 200 – the more specific policy always wins.
- **What is the hog limiter?** If one host takes >70% of a busy server link while others are active (two consecutive polls), an OpenFlow meter limits its server→host traffic to 50% of the link for 20 s. Victim throughput roughly doubled (1.72 → 3.47 Mbit/s).
- **Why was the limiter first unstable?** Thresholds were too tight and limited the victim; raised share to 0.7 and cap to 0.5 and unit-tested the policy.
- **What is the baseline?** Same topology with a standalone switch and no controller.
- **What do results show/not show?** SDN adds no measurable overhead; blocking protects the server from brute force; the limiter helps victims. They do not show SDN speeds up transfers. Samples are small (n=3–10).
- **Jain index?** (Σx)²/(n·Σx²); 1 = perfectly fair.
- **Limitations?** Shared-file channel, per-IP policy, no TLS, hard-coded accounts, meter applied after the bottleneck, small samples.
